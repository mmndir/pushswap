# pushswap
The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.
